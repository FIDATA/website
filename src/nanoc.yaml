# server when a directory is requested. Usually, index files are named

  # directory. For safety reasons, this is turned off by default.

# The data sources where nanoc loads its data from. This is an array of

    # The path where items should be mounted (comparable to mount points in
    # Unix-like systems). This is “/” by default, meaning that items will have

    # instead, an item at content/about.html would have an identifier of
    # “/en/about/” instead of just “/about/”.

    # past the first period is considered to be the extension, and when
    # turned on, only the characters past the last period are considered to
    # be the extension. For example,  a file named “content/about.html.erb”
    # will have the identifier “/about/” when turned off, but when turned on
